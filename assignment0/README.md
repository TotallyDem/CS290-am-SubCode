5 Websites that I like or dislike and why:
-https://rpgbot.net/
Although the website is simplistic, all of the necessary links to subdivisions of the website are
provided in the topmost section, with any relevant data such as updates to the website as a whole
being detailed below. Each of the sections when hovered over show the cotent available in broad
categories which help with locating what you need
-https://www.youtube.com/
The website front page is tailored to the previous activities of the user, includes a search bar
and a side section to look at previously marked content creators. However, for a first time user
the website is very flashy and will take some time getting used to
-https://moodle.linnbenton.edu/my/
For user experience, what point is there in having the tabs for past, current, and future classes
available to students if they get removed anyways.
For the generic version of the website shown to someone who is not logged in, there are no
announcements since april of 2021.
-https://www.reddit.com
The home page is minimalistic with a mobile first design, there is a large lack of ads that help with shown content based on previus user interaction, all with a dark mode. If the user is new to the platform it shows the most popular topics on it.
-https://www.thingiverse.com
This website starts itself off without much explanation to the user, just starts showing loads of 3d models for the user to download and print. It does include a search bar, several dropdown sorting menus and unintrusive ads, but the user experience is lacking explanation for how to use the site.

5 Websites which I recommend improvements for
-https://www.thingiverse.com
Change the landing page, have it be a tutorial on how to use to website. Have it show things like where to find file downloads, since that was pretty confusing when first using the site. Other than that, give me dark mode for my burning eyes.
-https://donatstudios.com/PixelCircleGenerator
Put the content which the user is for on the page where the user first loads at least. The generator is burried underneath the donate links and banner AD. Other than that, gimmie darkmode.
-https://en.wikipedia.org
The website is old styled, but that's part of its charm. However, there needs to be dark mode for this website full of black on white, at least give me an invert option.
-https://itch.io
The website is an excellent place to find cheap or often free games from a variety of platforms. Still going to mention darkmode ultil it becomes an HTML6 standard, but there are other things as well. There screen estate is entirely covered from tip to toe in images or text, but notably lacking an introduction to the platform beyond its basic purpose.
-https://octoprint.org
THIS IS NOT A REVIEW OF THE LINK GIVEN. This website links to a 3d printing webserver called ocotpi. It is a very useful web utility to make all of your older 3d printers web accessable. However the one major thing that irks me about it is the lack of options to pop out the webcam window so you can view it while looking at the temperature or gcode. Instead I need to inspect element the webstream and open a new tab to its specific location.z
