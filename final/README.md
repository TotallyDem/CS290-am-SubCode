For a web app I would want to make a snake clone as my first game.

This would likely need some javascript to run, and since I don't know such implementations the current website will be the first coat for the site asthetics.

To be frank, as I have nothing to work off of in terms of game code there will currently be just filler elements which will likely be removed in future iterations. Such as a table, fragment identifier, and even several lists. There will be a few snake images, and a random video that I found from a allegedly free use website.

--Change From week 2--
Added the ability to codify text by changing the font to the draconic font from dnd. I could use this font for a short story that reveals parts based on how long the snake gets. Other than that I applied borders, a background, and various little css tweaks. I also included the papyrus font just for the hell of it. 

--Changes for week 3-4--
I stripped out a lot of the earlier weeks content, cleaning up the appearance and trying to mimic the itch.io appearance for game pages. The webpage size is now dynamic to screen width, although it would be prefereable if it expanded to an aspect ratio instead.

--Changes for week 5-6--
Since we got to javascript, I finally implemented the snake game portion of the website. For the subpage I made some primitive code that demonstrates scope and input and output, the scope demonstation is in console. I also added a secondary subpage that demonstrates some basic PyScript, showing a demonstation of a button that increments a variable.

--Changes for Final--
Getting the serverside scripting done was easier that getting the php webserver setup. Nonetheless I have implemented a scoreboard which functions based on an honor system. You can easially edit scores such that they are way higher or lower than they should be. There does exist some input validation for the names, only allowing letter characters such that injection attacks should be non-existent. At least for ones that are submitted through the text box.
