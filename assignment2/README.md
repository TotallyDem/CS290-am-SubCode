For a web app I would want to make a snake clone as my first game.

This would likely need some javascript to run, and since I don't know such implementations the current website will be the first coat for the site asthetics.

To be frank, as I have nothing to work off of in terms of game code there will currently be just filler elements which will likely be removed in future iterations. Such as a table, fragment identifier, and even several lists. There will be a few snake images, and a random video that I found from a allegedly free use website.
